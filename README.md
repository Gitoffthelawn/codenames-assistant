# Codenames Assistant

## Installation

### Mozilla

## Usage

Nothing to setup or configure, just install the extension and play Codenames.

If you're already in a room, or just made one - you might need to refresh for the plugin to start.

## Features

### Notes Sidebar

Codenames Assistant adds a notepad in the red team's sidebar.

-   Make notes without using an external tool like notepad
-   Button to update the notes with a list of cards (grouped by team)
-   Button to automatically list word combinations, if there's a clue

### "Define Button

Codenames Assistant also adds a "Define" button when a clue has been given.

This currently opens a new tab with the Merriam Webster definition of the clue.

## Todo

-   "Wikipedia" button, for things that aren't in the dictionary (issue #1)
-   "Define" button for each card on the board, just in case (issue #2)
